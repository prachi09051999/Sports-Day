 2. You can select any event to participate in it and it'll be added to the list of <b>Selected Events</b>. The selected event will be in disabled state so that you can't select them again.
 3. You can select upto 3 events to participate. Trying to select more than 3 events will show error with an alert message.
 4. Trying to select an event whose timing is overlapping with any existing event will show error with an alert message.
